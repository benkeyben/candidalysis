## Problem Statement 
The district education department within the Ghana Education Service lacks a comprehensive system for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as enrollment, exam attendance, student aggregates, and subject-grade trends. This absence hampers their ability to effectively compare school and student performance and identify schools with high aggregate scores. There's a pressing need to streamline data collection, analysis, and visualization to facilitate informed decision-making and improve overall educational outcomes.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs) include
  - Enrolment in Junior High School 3
  - Number of candidates registered
  - Number of candidates present during examination
  - Number of candidates absent during examination
  - Subject grades
  - Number of candidates obtaining aggregates as indicated below:
    - Aggregates 6
    - Aggregates 7 - 15
    - Aggregates 16 - 24
    - Aggregates 25 - 30
    - Aggregates 31 - 36
    - Aggregates 36 - 42
